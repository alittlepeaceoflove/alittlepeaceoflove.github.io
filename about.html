    <p>
      My name is Julian. I’m a statistician exploring how data can improve the lives of humans and animals. I’ve worked with teams across various fields to help make sense of complex information and highlight the impact of their work. My goal is to help researchers, advocates, and changemakers tell clear, compelling stories with data and contribute to a better world.

    <h2>Professional Background</h2>

    <h3>Using Data to Support Communities</h3>
    <p>
      I oversee research and evaluation for federally funded prevention initiatives, including the Substance Abuse Block Grant, Prevention Partnership Grant (PPG), and the State Opioid Response Grant (SOR-P). I also conduct data analysis for a wide range of behavioral health and community programs, such as Case Management, Outpatient Treatment, Crisis Stabilization, Detoxification, Assisted Living, Mobile Crisis Response Teams (MRT), and Community Action Teams (CAT). My work focuses on program evaluation, incident reporting, satisfaction outcomes, and data-driven improvements to ensure services remain effective, accountable, and responsive to community needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Contributing to Public Health Research</h3>
    <p>
      I have conducted epidemiological analyses across a range of population health topics, including demographic patterns of uterine fibroids, the relationship between physical activity and hypertension outcomes across menopause, and an exploratory framework to assess inflammation (hsCRP) by HIV status and antiretroviral/PrEP exposure. I've also contributed to research on cardiometabolic health disparities in sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations, helping to identify inequities and inform public health interventions.
    </p>

    <h3>Protecting Animals Through Science</h3>
    <p>
      I have also contributed to wildlife toxicology research, analyzing anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposure in raptors. This work included assessing multi-compound co-exposures, dose-response patterns, weight-adjusted toxic burdens, and clinical/necropsy findings across multiple species. These analyses contributed to understanding geographic and toxicological patterns of AR exposure in rehabilitated raptors, with the aim of informing conservation and public health perspectives on secondary poisoning risks.
