      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Julian. I'm a statistician with over 8 years of experience working within the fields of substance abuse prevention, epidemiology, and animal welfare.

      <h2>Professional Background</h2>
      <p>
        At the Guidance/Care Center (GCC), a subsidiary of WestCare Foundation, I oversee research and evaluation for federally funded prevention grants, including the Substance Abuse Block Grant, Prevention Partnership Grant (PPG), and the State Opioid Response Grant (SOR-P). Through GCC, I also conduct data analysis for a wide range of clinical and community programs—such as Mobile Crisis Response, Outpatient Treatment, Crisis Stabilization, Detoxification, School-Based Services, and the Community Action Team. My work focuses on program evaluation, peer review analysis, and satisfaction outcomes, supporting both GCC and WestCare in ensuring services are effective, accountable, and responsive to community needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2025, I served as a Research Assistant with the University of Central Florida (UCF) Department of Health Sciences, where I conducted epidemiological analyses on a range of population health topics. My work included examining demographic patterns of uterine fibroids, investigating the relationship between physical activity and hypertension outcomes across menopause, developing an exploratory framework to assess inflammation (hsCRP) by HIV status and antiretroviral/PrEP exposure using All of Us data, and analyzing cardiometabolic health disparities in sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also in 2025, I collaborated with the Avian Conservation Center on a wildlife toxicology research project examining anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposure in raptors across South Carolina. I conducted a full data analysis assessing multi-compound co-exposures, dose–response patterns, weight-adjusted toxic burdens, and clinical/necropsy findings across multiple species. This work contributed to understanding geographic and toxicological patterns of AR exposure in rehabilitated raptors, with the goal of informing conservation and public health perspectives on secondary poisoning risks.
