    <p>
      My name is Julian. I’m a statistician exploring how data can improve the lives of humans and animals. I’ve worked with teams across various fields to help make sense of complex information and highlight the impact of their work. My goal is to help researchers, advocates, and changemakers tell clear, compelling stories with data and contribute to a better world.

    <h2>Professional Background</h2>

    <h3>Using Data to Support Communities</h3>
    <p>
      I oversee research and evaluation for federally funded prevention initiatives, including the Substance Abuse Block Grant, Prevention Partnership Grant (PPG), and the State Opioid Response Grant (SOR-P). I also conduct data analysis for a wide range of behavioral health and community programs, such as Case Management, Outpatient Treatment, Crisis Stabilization, Detoxification, Assisted Living, Mobile Crisis Response Teams (MRT), and Community Action Teams (CAT). My work focuses on program evaluation, incident reporting, satisfaction outcomes, and data-driven improvements to ensure services remain effective, accountable, and responsive to community needs.
    </p>

    <h3>Contributing to Public Health Research</h3>
    <p>
      I have conducted public health and epidemiological analyses on a range of population health topics, including reproductive health outcomes, the relationship between physical activity and cardiovascular risk factors, and inflammatory markers across different treatment exposures. My work has also included studying health disparities in underserved and minority populations, with a focus on cardiometabolic outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>Protecting Animals Through Science</h3>
    <p>
      I have also contributed to wildlife toxicology research, analyzing anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposure in raptors. This work included examining co-exposure patterns, toxic burdens, and clinical outcomes across multiple species. The analysis provided insights into geographic and ecological patterns of AR exposure, with implications for conservation and public health regarding secondary poisoning risks.
