      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Julian. I’m a statistician exploring how data can improve the lives of humans and animals. I’ve worked with teams across various fields to help make sense of complex information and highlight the impact of their work. My goal is to help researchers, advocates, and changemakers tell clear, compelling stories with data and contribute to a better world.

  <h2>Professional Background</h2>

  <h3>Using Data to Support Communities</h3>
  <p>
   At the Guidance/Care Center (GCC), a subsidiary of WestCare Foundation, I oversee research and evaluation for federally funded prevention grants, including the Substance Abuse Block Grant, Prevention Partnership Grant (PPG), and the State Opioid Response Grant (SOR-P). Through GCC, I also conduct data analysis for a wide range of clinical and community programs. These include Case Management, Outpatient Treatment, Crisis Stabilization, Detoxification, Assisted Living, and the Community Action Team (CAT). My work focuses on program evaluation, peer review analysis, incident reporting, and satisfaction outcomes, supporting both GCC and WestCare in ensuring services are effective, accountable, and responsive to community needs.
  </p>

  <h3>Contributing to Public Health Research</h3>
  <p>
    In 2025, I served as a Research Assistant with the University of Central Florida (UCF) Department of Health Sciences, where I conducted epidemiological analyses on a range of population health topics. My work included examining demographic patterns of uterine fibroids, investigating the relationship between physical activity and hypertension outcomes across menopause, developing an exploratory framework to assess inflammation (hsCRP) by HIV status and antiretroviral/PrEP exposure using All of Us data, and analyzing cardiometabolic health disparities in sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations.
  </p>

  <h3>Protecting Animals Through Science</h3>
  <p>
    Also in 2025, I collaborated with the Avian Conservation Center on a wildlife toxicology research project examining anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposure in raptors across South Carolina. I conducted a full data analysis assessing multi-compound co-exposures, dose–response patterns, weight-adjusted toxic burdens, and clinical/necropsy findings across multiple species. This work contributed to understanding geographic and toxicological patterns of AR exposure in rehabilitated raptors, with the goal of informing conservation and public health perspectives on secondary poisoning risks.
