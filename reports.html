    <h1>Reports & Analyses</h1>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Below is a collection of my data analyses and reports, spanning the various domains I’ve contributed to. Each report focuses on a specific question or theme and walks through the process of data collection, cleaning, organization, and analysis. These projects helped me and my collaborators uncover insights that supported stronger decisions and more meaningful outcomes in our work.

        <h3>Anticoagulant Rodenticide Exposure in South Carolina Raptors</h3>
        <p>
          Wildlife toxicology study examining anticoagulant rodenticide (AR) exposure in 
          raptors admitted across South Carolina. This report combines multi-year toxicology 
          results with demographic and necropsy data to evaluate patterns of single and 
          multi-compound exposure. Findings highlight regional risk factors and provide 
          important insights for environmental health and conservation efforts.

        <h3>Predictors of Heart Disease: Statistical Modeling and Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Research project analyzing predictors of heart disease using the CDC's 
          Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset. The analysis applies 
          logistic regression, chi-square testing, and interaction modeling to explore 
          lifestyle, demographic, and clinical factors. Results emphasize both individual 
          health behaviors and broader socioeconomic influences on cardiovascular risk.

        <h3>Demographic and Behavioral Correlates of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol</h3>
        <p>
          Statistical analysis of the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) 
          to identify demographic and behavioral factors linked to alcohol-impaired driving. 
          The report uses logistic regression, stepwise model selection, and ROC analysis 
          to evaluate predictors including binge drinking, education, and employment status. 
          Results provide evidence to inform prevention and public health strategies.
